# Stock Market Data Analysis with Python
This project focuses on analyzing historical stock market data using Python to gain insights into price trends, market momentum, and trading signals. The project uses data fetched from Yahoo Finance via the yfinance library and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to assess stock performance. Future stages of the project will involve the computation of various technical indicators commonly used in financial analysis and trading strategies, such as:

- Simple Moving Average (SMA)
- Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

# Project Features:
- Fetches historical stock price data for specific ticker symbols.
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to check data integrity and generate summary statistics.
- Visualizes stock price movements over time.
- Computes technical indicators to aid in stock analysis and potential strategy development.

# Tools and Libraries Used:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visualizations and plots.
- **YFinance**: For retrieving stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array handling.

# Planned Features:
- Implement a simple trading strategy based on technical indicators.
- Backtest trading strategies to evaluate their historical performance.
- Add more technical indicators and potentially machine learning models for predictive analysis.
